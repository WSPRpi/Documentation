Documentation for the WSPRpi

The Builder folder contains instructions needed to build a standard WSPRpi 
using provided output files with no option for customisation.

If you wish to write custom software, further instructions are in the Developer folder.

These instructions all assume you are using a Windows 10 machine using the software (MPLABX IPE and Arduino IDE) that I used to develop WSPRpi.

PLEASE NOTE: This is a personal project which I am sharing for free as people seemed interested.
I have tried to write helpful instructions that don't require in depth knowledge of the software / procedures used.
However, they only cover the way I did things, if you would like to use other software / OS, feel free but 
I don't intend to write instructions for them. If you do things another way, consider writing them up for others?

Any refinements on clarity / constructive feedback to @m0wut on Twitter or my email address on qrz.com
