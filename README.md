Documentation for the WSPRpi

The Builder folder contains instructions needed to build a standard WSPRpi 
using provided output files with no option for customisation.

If you wish to write custom software, further instructions are in the Developer folder.

These instructions all assume you are using a Windows machine using the software that I used to develop WSPRpi.
If this doesn't suit... sorry but tough.

PLEASE NOTE: This is a freely distributed work, I don't enjoy writing instructions and you aren't paying me to.
If there are tiny spelling errors / I didn't explain how to program it using Windows 3.1 in Spanish, you really don't have grounds to complain.
Certain commercial ham radio kits give you just a BOM and info spread across 7 documents in several places including a Yahoo group so.... you're welcome :)

Any refinements on clarity / useful feedback to @m0wut on Twitter or my email address on qrz.com
